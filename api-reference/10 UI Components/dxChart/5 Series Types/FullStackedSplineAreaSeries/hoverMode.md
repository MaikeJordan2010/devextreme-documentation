##### shortDescription
Specifies series elements to be highlighted when a user points to a series.

---
When a user points to a series, it may react in one of the following ways depending on the value of the **hoverMode** property.

<table class="dx-table">
    <tr>
        <th>hoverMode</th>
        <th>Result</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>"nearestPoint"</i></td>
        <td><img src="/images/ChartJS/hoverMode/series/fullstackedsplinearea/nearestPoint.png" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>"includePoints"</i></td>
        <td><img src="/images/ChartJS/hoverMode/series/fullstackedsplinearea/includePoints.png" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>"excludePoints"</i></td>
        <td><img src="/images/ChartJS/hoverMode/series/fullstackedsplinearea/excludePoints.png" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>"none"</i></td>
        <td><img src="/images/ChartJS/hoverMode/series/fullstackedsplinearea/none.png" /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

[note]Points in full-stacked spline area series are hidden by default. To make them visible, assign **true** to the **point**.**visible** property.

#include common-ref-enum with {
    enum: "`ChartSeriesHoverMode`",
    values: "`NearestPoint`, `IncludePoints`, `ExcludePoints`, and `None`"
} Note that although this enum accepts more values, only the listed ones can be applied to a full-stacked spline area series.
